# Simple Acoustic Ray Tracer

A very bare-bones acoustic ray tracer that allows you to create a room and create a rough rough rough approximation of the early reverberations.
This codebase depends on openFrameworks which handles the GUI portion of the ray tracer.

This is a work in progress.  Over time, we hope to add better acoustics and material modelling and eventually, the ability to make 3D rooms.
As it stands right now, it's a fun pong-like visualizations.
